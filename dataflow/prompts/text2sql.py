        **Task Overview**
        Determine if the SQL query is correctly answering the given question based on the provided schema.

        **Question**
        {question}

        **SQL**
        {sql}

        **Schema**
        {db_details}

        **Evaluation Criteria**
        1. **Logical Alignment**: Does the SQL query logically address what the question is asking?
        2. **Schema Compliance**: Are the tables, columns, and relationships used correctly according to the schema?
        3. **Completeness**: Does the SQL capture all necessary conditions and requirements from the question?
        4. **Correctness**: Are there any logical errors that would prevent getting the correct answer?

        **Output Format**:
        The conclusion should be enclosed in a code block:
        ```
        <Conclusion> YES/NO </Conclusion>
        ```

        **Decision Rules**
        - YES: SQL correctly implements the question requirements
        - NO: SQL has logical errors or doesn't address the question properly
        - When uncertain about edge cases, explain the uncertainty in analysis but still provide a definitive YES/NO

        **Answer**
        Let's proceed step by step.

            "ABS(X) \nDescription: The ABS(X) function returns the absolute value of the numeric argument X. Abs(X) returns NULL if X is NULL. Abs(X) returns 0.0 if X is a string or blob that cannot be converted to a numeric value. If X is the integer -9223372036854775808 then ABS(X) throws an integer overflow error since there is no equivalent positive 64-bit two complement value. ",
            "CHANGES() \nDescription: The CHANGES() function returns the number of database rows that were changed or inserted or deleted by the most recently completed INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE statement, exclusive of statements in lower-level triggers. The CHANGES() SQL function is a wrapper around thesqlite3_changes64()C/C++ function and hence follows the same rules for counting changes. ",
            "CHAR(X1,X2,...,XN) \nDescription: The CHAR(X1,X2,...,XN) function returns a string composed of characters having the unicode code point values of integers X1 through XN, respectively. ",
            "COALESCE(X,Y,...) \nDescription: The COALESCE() function returns a copy of its first non-NULL argument, or NULL if all arguments are NULL. Coalesce() must have at least 2 arguments. ",
            "CONCAT(X,...) \nDescription: The CONCAT(...) function returns a string which is the concatenation of the string representation of all of its non-NULL arguments. If all arguments are NULL, then CONCAT() returns an empty string. ",
            "CONCAT_WS(SEP,X,...) \nDescription: The CONCAT_WS(SEP,...) function returns a string that is the concatenation of all non-null arguments beyond the first argument, using the text value of the first argument as a separator. If the first argument is NULL, then CONCAT_WS() returns NULL. If all arguments other than the first are NULL, then CONCAT_WS() returns an empty string. ",
            "FORMAT(FORMAT,...) \nDescription: The FORMAT(FORMAT,...) SQL function works like thesqlite3_mprintf()C-language function and the printf() function from the standard C library. The first argument is a format string that specifies how to construct the output string using values taken from subsequent arguments. If the FORMAT argument is missing or NULL then the result is NULL. The %n format is silently ignored and does not consume an argument. The %p format is an alias for %X. The %z format is interchangeable with %s. If there are too few arguments in the argument list, missing arguments are assumed to have a NULL value, which is translated into 0 or 0.0 for numeric formats or an empty string for %s. See thebuilt-in printf()documentation for additional information. ",
            "GLOB(X,Y) \nDescription: The GLOB(X,Y) function is equivalent to the expression \"Y GLOB X\". Note that the X and Y arguments are reversed in the GLOB() function relative to the infixGLOBoperator. Y is the string and X is the pattern. So, for example, the following expressions are equivalent:name GLOB '*helium*' GLOB('*helium*',name)If thesqlite3_create_function()interface is used to override the GLOB(X,Y) function with an alternative implementation then theGLOBoperator will invoke the alternative implementation. ",
            "HEX(X) \nDescription: The HEX() function interprets its argument as a BLOB and returns a string which is the upper-case hexadecimal rendering of the content of that blob.If the argumentXin \"hex(X)\" is an integer or floating point number, then \"interprets its argument as a BLOB\" means that the binary number is first converted into a UTF8 text representation, then that text is interpreted as a BLOB. Hence, \"hex(12345678)\" renders as \"3132333435363738\" not the binary representation of the integer value \"0000000000BC614E\".See also:unhex() ",
            "IFNULL(X,Y) \nDescription: The IFNULL() function returns a copy of its first non-NULL argument, or NULL if both arguments are NULL. Ifnull() must have exactly 2 arguments. The IFNULL() function is equivalent tocoalesce()with two arguments. ",
            "IIF(X,Y,Z) \nDescription: The IIF(X,Y,Z) function returns the value Y if X is true, and Z otherwise. The IIF(X,Y,Z) function is logically equivalent to and generates the samebytecodeas theCASE expression\"CASE WHEN X THEN Y ELSE Z END\". ",
            "INSTR(X,Y) \nDescription: The INSTR(X,Y) function finds the first occurrence of string Y within string X and returns the number of prior characters plus 1, or 0 if Y is nowhere found within X. Or, if X and Y are both BLOBs, then INSTR(X,Y) returns one more than the number bytes prior to the first occurrence of Y, or 0 if Y does not occur anywhere within X. If both arguments X and Y to INSTR(X,Y) are non-NULL and are not BLOBs then both are interpreted as strings. If either X or Y are NULL in INSTR(X,Y) then the result is NULL. ",
            "LAST_INSERT_ROWID() \nDescription: The LAST_INSERT_ROWID() function returns theROWIDof the last row insert from the database connection which invoked the function. The LAST_INSERT_ROWID() SQL function is a wrapper around thesqlite3_last_insert_rowid()C/C++ interface function. ",
            "LENGTH(X) \nDescription: For a string value X, the LENGTH(X) function returns the number of characters (not bytes) in X prior to the first NUL character. Since SQLite strings do not normally contain NUL characters, the LENGTH(X) function will usually return the total number of characters in the string X. For a blob value X, LENGTH(X) returns the number of bytes in the blob. If X is NULL then LENGTH(X) is NULL. If X is numeric then LENGTH(X) returns the length of a string representation of X.Note that for strings, the LENGTH(X) function returns thecharacterlength of the string, not the byte length. The character length is the number of characters in the string. The character length is always different from the byte length for UTF-16 strings, and can be different from the byte length for UTF-8 strings if the string contains multi-byte characters. Use theoctet_length()function to find the byte length of a string.For BLOB values, LENGTH(X) always returns the byte-length of the BLOB.For string values, LENGTH(X) must read the entire string into memory in order to compute the character length. But for BLOB values, that is not necessary as SQLite knows how many bytes are in the BLOB. Hence, for multi-megabyte values, the LENGTH(X) function is usually much faster for BLOBs than for strings, since it does not need to load the value into memory. ",
            "LIKE(X,Y) or LIKE(X,Y,Z) \nDescription: The LIKE() function is used to implement the \"Y LIKE X [ESCAPE Z]\" expression. If the optional ESCAPE clause is present, then the LIKE() function is invoked with three arguments. Otherwise, it is invoked with two arguments only. Note that the X and Y parameters are reversed in the LIKE() function relative to the infixLIKEoperator. X is the pattern and Y is the string to match against that pattern. Hence, the following expressions are equivalent:name LIKE '%neon%' LIKE('%neon%',name)Thesqlite3_create_function()interface can be used to override the LIKE() function and thereby change the operation of theLIKEoperator. When overriding the LIKE() function, it may be important to override both the two and three argument versions of the LIKE() function. Otherwise, different code may be called to implement theLIKEoperator depending on whether or not an ESCAPE clause was specified. ",
            "LIKELIHOOD(X,Y) \nDescription: The LIKELIHOOD(X,Y) function returns argument X unchanged. The value Y in LIKELIHOOD(X,Y) must be a floating point constant between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. The LIKELIHOOD(X) function is a no-op that the code generator optimizes away so that it consumes no CPU cycles during run-time (that is, during calls tosqlite3_step()). The purpose of the LIKELIHOOD(X,Y) function is to provide a hint to the query planner that the argument X is a boolean that is true with a probability of approximately Y. Theunlikely(X)function is short-hand for LIKELIHOOD(X,0.0625). Thelikely(X)function is short-hand for LIKELIHOOD(X,0.9375). ",
            "LIKELY(X) \nDescription: The LIKELY(X) function returns the argument X unchanged. The LIKELY(X) function is a no-op that the code generator optimizes away so that it consumes no CPU cycles at run-time (that is, during calls tosqlite3_step()). The purpose of the LIKELY(X) function is to provide a hint to the query planner that the argument X is a boolean value that is usually true. The LIKELY(X) function is equivalent tolikelihood(X,0.9375). See also:unlikely(X). ",
            "LOAD_EXTENSION(X) or LOAD_EXTENSION(X,Y) \nDescription: The LOAD_EXTENSION(X,Y) function loadsSQLite extensionsout of the shared library file named X using the entry point Y. The result of LOAD_EXTENSION() is always a NULL. If Y is omitted then the default entry point name is used. The LOAD_EXTENSION() function raises an exception if the extension fails to load or initialize correctly.The LOAD_EXTENSION() function will fail if the extension attempts to modify or delete an SQL function or collating sequence. The extension can add new functions or collating sequences, but cannot modify or delete existing functions or collating sequences because those functions and/or collating sequences might be used elsewhere in the currently running SQL statement. To load an extension that changes or deletes functions or collating sequences, use thesqlite3_load_extension()C-language API.For security reasons, extension loading is disabled by default and must be enabled by a prior call tosqlite3_enable_load_extension(). ",
            "LOWER(X) \nDescription: The LOWER(X) function returns a copy of string X with all ASCII characters converted to lower case. The default built-in LOWER() function works for ASCII characters only. To do case conversions on non-ASCII characters, load the ICU extension. ",
            "LTRIM(X) or LTRIM(X,Y) \nDescription: The LTRIM(X,Y) function returns a string formed by removing any and all characters that appear in Y from the left side of X. If the Y argument is omitted, LTRIM(X) removes spaces from the left side of X. ",
            "MAX(X,Y,...) \nDescription: The multi-argument MAX() function returns the argument with the maximum value, or return NULL if any argument is NULL. The multi-argument MAX() function searches its arguments from left to right for an argument that defines a collating function and uses that collating function for all string comparisons. If none of the arguments to MAX() define a collating function, then the BINARY collating function is used. Note thatmax()is a simple function when it has 2 or more arguments but operates as anaggregate functionif given only a single argument. ",
            "MIN(X,Y,...) \nDescription: The multi-argument MIN() function returns the argument with the minimum value. The multi-argument MIN() function searches its arguments from left to right for an argument that defines a collating function and uses that collating function for all string comparisons. If none of the arguments to MIN() define a collating function, then the BINARY collating function is used. Note thatmin()is a simple function when it has 2 or more arguments but operates as anaggregate functionif given only a single argument. ",
            "NULLIF(X,Y) \nDescription: The NULLIF(X,Y) function returns its first argument if the arguments are different and NULL if the arguments are the same. The NULLIF(X,Y) function searches its arguments from left to right for an argument that defines a collating function and uses that collating function for all string comparisons. If neither argument to NULLIF() defines a collating function then the BINARY collating function is used. ",
            "OCTET_LENGTH(X) \nDescription: The OCTET_LENGTH(X) function returns the number of bytes in the encoding of text string X. If X is NULL then OCTET_LENGTH(X) returns NULL. If X is a BLOB value, then OCTET_LENGTH(X) is the same aslength(X). If X is a numeric value, then OCTET_LENGTH(X) returns the number of bytes in a text rendering of that number.Because OCTET_LENGTH(X) returns the number of bytes in X, not the number of characters, the value returned depends on the database encoding. The OCTET_LENGTH() function can return different answers for the same input string if the database encoding is UTF16 instead of UTF8.If argument X is a table column and the value is of type text or blob, then OCTET_LENGTH(X) avoids reading the content of X from disk, as the byte length can be computed from metadata. Thus, OCTET_LENGTH(X) is efficient even if X is a column containing a multi-megabyte text or blob value. ",
            "PRINTF(FORMAT,...) \nDescription: The PRINTF() SQL function is an alias for theformat() SQL function. The format() SQL function was originally named PRINTF(). But the name was later changed to format() for compatibility with other database engines. The PRINTF() name is retained as an alias so as not to break legacy code. ",
            "QUOTE(X) \nDescription: The QUOTE(X) function returns the text of an SQL literal which is the value of its argument suitable for inclusion into an SQL statement. Strings are surrounded by single-quotes with escapes on interior quotes as needed. BLOBs are encoded as hexadecimal literals. Strings with embedded NUL characters cannot be represented as string literals in SQL and hence the returned string literal is truncated prior to the first NUL. ",
            "RANDOM() \nDescription: The RANDOM() function returns a pseudo-random integer between -9223372036854775808 and +9223372036854775807. ",
            "RANDOMBLOB(N) \nDescription: The RANDOMBLOB(N) function return an N-byte blob containing pseudo-random bytes. If N is less than 1 then a 1-byte random blob is returned.Hint: applications can generate globally unique identifiers using this function together withhex()and/orlower()like this:hex(randomblob(16))lower(hex(randomblob(16))) ",
            "REPLACE(X,Y,Z) \nDescription: The REPLACE(X,Y,Z) function returns a string formed by substituting string Z for every occurrence of string Y in string X. TheBINARYcollating sequence is used for comparisons. If Y is an empty string then return X unchanged. If Z is not initially a string, it is cast to a UTF-8 string prior to processing. ",
            "ROUND(X) or ROUND(X,Y) \nDescription: The ROUND(X,Y) function returns a floating-point value X rounded to Y digits to the right of the decimal point. If the Y argument is omitted or negative, it is taken to be 0. ",
            "RTRIM(X) or RTRIM(X,Y) \nDescription: The RTRIM(X,Y) function returns a string formed by removing any and all characters that appear in Y from the right side of X. If the Y argument is omitted, RTRIM(X) removes spaces from the right side of X. ",
            "SIGN(X) \nDescription: The SIGN(X) function returns -1, 0, or +1 if the argument X is a numeric value that is negative, zero, or positive, respectively. If the argument to SIGN(X) is NULL or is a string or blob that cannot be losslessly converted into a number, then SIGN(X) returns NULL. ",
            "SOUNDEX(X) \nDescription: The SOUNDEX(X) function returns a string that is the soundex encoding of the string X. The string \"?000\" is returned if the argument is NULL or contains no ASCII alphabetic characters. This function is omitted from SQLite by default. It is only available if theSQLITE_SOUNDEXcompile-time option is used when SQLite is built. ",
            "SQLITE_COMPILEOPTION_GET(N) \nDescription: The SQLITE_COMPILEOPTION_GET() SQL function is a wrapper around thesqlite3_compileoption_get()C/C++ function. This routine returns the N-th compile-time option used to build SQLite or NULL if N is out of range. See also thecompile_options pragma. ",
            "SQLITE_COMPILEOPTION_USED(X) \nDescription: The SQLITE_COMPILEOPTION_USED() SQL function is a wrapper around thesqlite3_compileoption_used()C/C++ function. When the argument X to SQLITE_COMPILEOPTION_USED(X) is a string which is the name of a compile-time option, this routine returns true (1) or false (0) depending on whether or not that option was used during the build. ",
            "SQLITE_OFFSET(X) \nDescription: The SQLITE_OFFSET(X) function returns the byte offset in the database file for the beginning of the record from which value would be read. If X is not a column in an ordinary table, then SQLITE_OFFSET(X) returns NULL. The value returned by SQLITE_OFFSET(X) might reference either the original table or an index, depending on the query. If the value X would normally be extracted from an index, the SQLITE_OFFSET(X) returns the offset to the corresponding index record. If the value X would be extracted from the original table, then SQLITE_OFFSET(X) returns the offset to the table record.The SQLITE_OFFSET(X) SQL function is only available if SQLite is built using the-DSQLITE_ENABLE_OFFSET_SQL_FUNCcompile-time option. ",
            "SQLITE_SOURCE_ID() \nDescription: The SQLITE_SOURCE_ID() function returns a string that identifies the specific version of the source code that was used to build the SQLite library. The string returned by SQLITE_SOURCE_ID() is the date and time that the source code was checked in followed by the SHA3-256 hash for that check-in.

If Z is omitted then SUBSTR(X,Y) returns all characters through the end of the string X beginning with the Y-th. The left-most character of X is number 1. If Y is negative then the first character of the substring is found by counting from the right rather than the left. If Z is negative then the abs(Z) characters preceding the Y-th character are returned. If X is a string then characters indices refer to actual UTF-8 characters. If X is a BLOB then the indices refer to bytes.\"substring()\" is an alias for \"substr()\" beginning with SQLite version 3.34. ",

If X contains any characters that are not hexadecimal digits and which are not in Y, then UNHEX(X,Y) returns NULL. If Y is omitted, it is understood to be an empty string and hence X must be a pure hexadecimal string. All hexadecimal digits in X must occur in pairs, with both digits of each pair beginning immediately adjacent to one another, or else UNHEX(X,Y) returns NULL. If either parameter X or Y is NULL, then UNHEX(X,Y) returns NULL. The X input may contain an arbitrary mix of upper and lower case hexadecimal digits. Hexadecimal digits in Y have no affect on the translation of X. Only characters in Y that are not hexadecimal digits are ignored in X.See also:hex() ",

If there are no non-NULL input rows then SUM() returns NULL but TOTAL() returns 0.0. NULL is not normally a helpful result for the sum of no rows but the SQL standard requires it and most other SQL database engines implement SUM() that way so SQLite does it in the same way in order to be compatible.

Abs(X) returns 0.0 if X is a string or blob that cannot be converted to a numeric value. If X is the integer -9223372036854775808 then ABS(X) throws an integer overflow error since there is no equivalent positive 64-bit two complement value. ",
            "CHANGES() \nDescription: The CHANGES() function returns the number of database rows that were changed or inserted or deleted by the most recently completed INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE statement, exclusive of statements in lower-level triggers. The CHANGES() SQL function is a wrapper around thesqlite3_changes64()C/C++ function and hence follows the same rules for counting changes. ",
            "CHAR(X1,X2,...,XN) \nDescription: The CHAR(X1,X2,...,XN) function returns a string composed of characters having the unicode code point values of integers X1 through XN, respectively. ",
            "COALESCE(X,Y,...) \nDescription: The COALESCE() function returns a copy of its first non-NULL argument, or NULL if all arguments are NULL. Coalesce() must have at least 2 arguments. ",
            "CONCAT(X,...) \nDescription: The CONCAT(...) function returns a string which is the concatenation of the string representation of all of its non-NULL arguments. If all arguments are NULL, then CONCAT() returns an empty string. ",

If the first argument is NULL, then CONCAT_WS() returns NULL. If all arguments other than the first are NULL, then CONCAT_WS() returns an empty string. ",
            "FORMAT(FORMAT,...) \nDescription: The FORMAT(FORMAT,...) SQL function works like thesqlite3_mprintf()C-language function and the printf() function from the standard C library. The first argument is a format string that specifies how to construct the output string using values taken from subsequent arguments. If the FORMAT argument is missing or NULL then the result is NULL. The %n format is silently ignored and does not consume an argument. The %p format is an alias for %X. The %z format is interchangeable with %s. If there are too few arguments in the argument list, missing arguments are assumed to have a NULL value, which is translated into 0 or 0.0 for numeric formats or an empty string for %s. See thebuilt-in printf()documentation for additional information. ",
            "GLOB(X,Y) \nDescription: The GLOB(X,Y) function is equivalent to the expression \"Y GLOB X\". Note that the X and Y arguments are reversed in the GLOB() function relative to the infixGLOBoperator. Y is the string and X is the pattern. So, for example, the following expressions are equivalent:name GLOB '*helium*' GLOB('*helium*',name)If thesqlite3_create_function()interface is used to override the GLOB(X,Y) function with an alternative implementation then theGLOBoperator will invoke the alternative implementation. ",

Hence, \"hex(12345678)\" renders as \"3132333435363738\" not the binary representation of the integer value \"0000000000BC614E\".See also:unhex() ",
            "IFNULL(X,Y) \nDescription: The IFNULL() function returns a copy of its first non-NULL argument, or NULL if both arguments are NULL. Ifnull() must have exactly 2 arguments. The IFNULL() function is equivalent tocoalesce()with two arguments. ",

            "INSTR(X,Y) \nDescription: The INSTR(X,Y) function finds the first occurrence of string Y within string X and returns the number of prior characters plus 1, or 0 if Y is nowhere found within X. Or, if X and Y are both BLOBs, then INSTR(X,Y) returns one more than the number bytes prior to the first occurrence of Y, or 0 if Y does not occur anywhere within X. If both arguments X and Y to INSTR(X,Y) are non-NULL and are not BLOBs then both are interpreted as strings. If either X or Y are NULL in INSTR(X,Y) then the result is NULL. ",
            "LAST_INSERT_ROWID() \nDescription: The LAST_INSERT_ROWID() function returns theROWIDof the last row insert from the database connection which invoked the function. The LAST_INSERT_ROWID() SQL function is a wrapper around thesqlite3_last_insert_rowid()C/C++ interface function. ",
            "LENGTH(X) \nDescription: For a string value X, the LENGTH(X) function returns the number of characters (not bytes) in X prior to the first NUL character. Since SQLite strings do not normally contain NUL characters, the LENGTH(X) function will usually return the total number of characters in the string X. For a blob value X, LENGTH(X) returns the number of bytes in the blob. If X is NULL then LENGTH(X) is NULL. If X is numeric then LENGTH(X) returns the length of a string representation of X.Note that for strings, the LENGTH(X) function returns thecharacterlength of the string, not the byte length. The character length is the number of characters in the string. The character length is always different from the byte length for UTF-16 strings, and can be different from the byte length for UTF-8 strings if the string contains multi-byte characters. Use theoctet_length()function to find the byte length of a string.For BLOB values, LENGTH(X) always returns the byte-length of the BLOB.For string values, LENGTH(X) must read the entire string into memory in order to compute the character length. But for BLOB values, that is not necessary as SQLite knows how many bytes are in the BLOB. Hence, for multi-megabyte values, the LENGTH(X) function is usually much faster for BLOBs than for strings, since it does not need to load the value into memory. ",
            "LIKE(X,Y) or LIKE(X,Y,Z) \nDescription: The LIKE() function is used to implement the \"Y LIKE X [ESCAPE Z]\" expression. If the optional ESCAPE clause is present, then the LIKE() function is invoked with three arguments. Otherwise, it is invoked with two arguments only. Note that the X and Y parameters are reversed in the LIKE() function relative to the infixLIKEoperator. X is the pattern and Y is the string to match against that pattern. Hence, the following expressions are equivalent:name LIKE '%neon%' LIKE('%neon%',name)Thesqlite3_create_function()interface can be used to override the LIKE() function and thereby change the operation of theLIKEoperator. When overriding the LIKE() function, it may be important to override both the two and three argument versions of the LIKE() function. Otherwise, different code may be called to implement theLIKEoperator depending on whether or not an ESCAPE clause was specified. ",
            "LIKELIHOOD(X,Y) \nDescription: The LIKELIHOOD(X,Y) function returns argument X unchanged. The value Y in LIKELIHOOD(X,Y) must be a floating point constant between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. The LIKELIHOOD(X) function is a no-op that the code generator optimizes away so that it consumes no CPU cycles during run-time (that is, during calls tosqlite3_step()). The purpose of the LIKELIHOOD(X,Y) function is to provide a hint to the query planner that the argument X is a boolean that is true with a probability of approximately Y. Theunlikely(X)function is short-hand for LIKELIHOOD(X,0.0625). Thelikely(X)function is short-hand for LIKELIHOOD(X,0.9375). ",

The LIKELY(X) function is a no-op that the code generator optimizes away so that it consumes no CPU cycles at run-time (that is, during calls tosqlite3_step()). The purpose of the LIKELY(X) function is to provide a hint to the query planner that the argument X is a boolean value that is usually true. The LIKELY(X) function is equivalent tolikelihood(X,0.9375). See also:unlikely(X). ",
            "LOAD_EXTENSION(X) or LOAD_EXTENSION(X,Y) \nDescription: The LOAD_EXTENSION(X,Y) function loadsSQLite extensionsout of the shared library file named X using the entry point Y. The result of LOAD_EXTENSION() is always a NULL. If Y is omitted then the default entry point name is used. The LOAD_EXTENSION() function raises an exception if the extension fails to load or initialize correctly.The LOAD_EXTENSION() function will fail if the extension attempts to modify or delete an SQL function or collating sequence. The extension can add new functions or collating sequences, but cannot modify or delete existing functions or collating sequences because those functions and/or collating sequences might be used elsewhere in the currently running SQL statement. To load an extension that changes or deletes functions or collating sequences, use thesqlite3_load_extension()C-language API.For security reasons, extension loading is disabled by default and must be enabled by a prior call tosqlite3_enable_load_extension(). ",
            "LOWER(X) \nDescription: The LOWER(X) function returns a copy of string X with all ASCII characters converted to lower case. The default built-in LOWER() function works for ASCII characters only. To do case conversions on non-ASCII characters, load the ICU extension. ",
            "LTRIM(X) or LTRIM(X,Y) \nDescription: The LTRIM(X,Y) function returns a string formed by removing any and all characters that appear in Y from the left side of X. If the Y argument is omitted, LTRIM(X) removes spaces from the left side of X. ",
            "MAX(X,Y,...) \nDescription: The multi-argument MAX() function returns the argument with the maximum value, or return NULL if any argument is NULL. The multi-argument MAX() function searches its arguments from left to right for an argument that defines a collating function and uses that collating function for all string comparisons. If none of the arguments to MAX() define a collating function, then the BINARY collating function is used. Note thatmax()is a simple function when it has 2 or more arguments but operates as anaggregate functionif given only a single argument. ",
            "MIN(X,Y,...) \nDescription: The multi-argument MIN() function returns the argument with the minimum value. The multi-argument MIN() function searches its arguments from left to right for an argument that defines a collating function and uses that collating function for all string comparisons. If none of the arguments to MIN() define a collating function, then the BINARY collating function is used. Note thatmin()is a simple function when it has 2 or more arguments but operates as anaggregate functionif given only a single argument. ",
            "NULLIF(X,Y) \nDescription: The NULLIF(X,Y) function returns its first argument if the arguments are different and NULL if the arguments are the same. The NULLIF(X,Y) function searches its arguments from left to right for an argument that defines a collating function and uses that collating function for all string comparisons. If neither argument to NULLIF() defines a collating function then the BINARY collating function is used. ",
            "OCTET_LENGTH(X) \nDescription: The OCTET_LENGTH(X) function returns the number of bytes in the encoding of text string X. If X is NULL then OCTET_LENGTH(X) returns NULL. If X is a BLOB value, then OCTET_LENGTH(X) is the same aslength(X). If X is a numeric value, then OCTET_LENGTH(X) returns the number of bytes in a text rendering of that number.Because OCTET_LENGTH(X) returns the number of bytes in X, not the number of characters, the value returned depends on the database encoding. The OCTET_LENGTH() function can return different answers for the same input string if the database encoding is UTF16 instead of UTF8.If argument X is a table column and the value is of type text or blob, then OCTET_LENGTH(X) avoids reading the content of X from disk, as the byte length can be computed from metadata. Thus, OCTET_LENGTH(X) is efficient even if X is a column containing a multi-megabyte text or blob value. ",
            "PRINTF(FORMAT,...) \nDescription: The PRINTF() SQL function is an alias for theformat() SQL function. The format() SQL function was originally named PRINTF(). But the name was later changed to format() for compatibility with other database engines. The PRINTF() name is retained as an alias so as not to break legacy code. ",
            "QUOTE(X) \nDescription: The QUOTE(X) function returns the text of an SQL literal which is the value of its argument suitable for inclusion into an SQL statement. Strings are surrounded by single-quotes with escapes on interior quotes as needed. BLOBs are encoded as hexadecimal literals. Strings with embedded NUL characters cannot be represented as string literals in SQL and hence the returned string literal is truncated prior to the first NUL. ",
            "RANDOM() \nDescription: The RANDOM() function returns a pseudo-random integer between -9223372036854775808 and +9223372036854775807. ",

When the argument X to SQLITE_COMPILEOPTION_USED(X) is a string which is the name of a compile-time option, this routine returns true (1) or false (0) depending on whether or not that option was used during the build. ",
            "SQLITE_OFFSET(X) \nDescription: The SQLITE_OFFSET(X) function returns the byte offset in the database file for the beginning of the record from which value would be read. If X is not a column in an ordinary table, then SQLITE_OFFSET(X) returns NULL. The value returned by SQLITE_OFFSET(X) might reference either the original table or an index, depending on the query. If the value X would normally be extracted from an index, the SQLITE_OFFSET(X) returns the offset to the corresponding index record. If the value X would be extracted from the original table, then SQLITE_OFFSET(X) returns the offset to the table record.The SQLITE_OFFSET(X) SQL function is only available if SQLite is built using the-DSQLITE_ENABLE_OFFSET_SQL_FUNCcompile-time option. ",
            "SQLITE_SOURCE_ID() \nDescription: The SQLITE_SOURCE_ID() function returns a string that identifies the specific version of the source code that was used to build the SQLite library. The string returned by SQLITE_SOURCE_ID() is the date and time that the source code was checked in followed by the SHA3-256 hash for that check-in.

If Z is omitted then SUBSTR(X,Y) returns all characters through the end of the string X beginning with the Y-th. The left-most character of X is number 1. If Y is negative then the first character of the substring is found by counting from the right rather than the left. If Z is negative then the abs(Z) characters preceding the Y-th character are returned. If X is a string then characters indices refer to actual UTF-8 characters. If X is a BLOB then the indices refer to bytes.\"substring()\" is an alias for \"substr()\" beginning with SQLite version 3.34. ",

If X contains any characters that are not hexadecimal digits and which are not in Y, then UNHEX(X,Y) returns NULL. If Y is omitted, it is understood to be an empty string and hence X must be a pure hexadecimal string. All hexadecimal digits in X must occur in pairs, with both digits of each pair beginning immediately adjacent to one another, or else UNHEX(X,Y) returns NULL. If either parameter X or Y is NULL, then UNHEX(X,Y) returns NULL. The X input may contain an arbitrary mix of upper and lower case hexadecimal digits. Hexadecimal digits in Y have no affect on the translation of X. Only characters in Y that are not hexadecimal digits are ignored in X.See also:hex() ",

        Create an executable VecSQL query based on the provided information.

        **Database Schema**
        {schema_str}

        {sql_function_prompt}

        {db_value_prompt}

        **SQL Query Complexity**
        Ensure the SQL query matches the {complexity} level, defined as follows:
        {criterion}

        **Output Format Requirements**
        Enclose the SQL query in a code block:
        ```sql
        -- Your SQL query here
        ```

        **SQL Query Requirements**
        0. (MANDATORY) The generated SQL query MUST be a VecSQL query. It MUST contain a vector similarity search using the `MATCH lembed(...)` syntax. This search MUST be performed on a column that ends with `_embedding`.
        1. Use the syntax specific to the {db_engine} database engine.
        2. Incorporate advanced functions if appropriate, but they are not mandatory.
        3. Address real-world data analysis needs. Avoid trivial or nonsensical queries.
        4. (Very important) Ensure the final SQL query selects {column_count} columns.
        5. (Very important) Always verify that every column name you reference in a query exists in the tables you're querying. Before executing a query, ensure all referenced columns (e.g., column1, table1.id) are valid and spelled correctly.


        **SQL extension**
        Extension: sqlite_vec and sqlite_lembed.

        There are a few Requirements you should Comply with in addition, else you can ignore these requirements below.
        1. When generating SQL queries, you should prioritize utilizing KNN searches whenever contextually appropriate. However, you have to avoid unnecessary/forced KNN implementations for:
        --Traditional relational data queries (especially for columns like: id, age, price)
        --Cases where standard SQL operators (equality, range, or aggregation functions) are more efficient and semantically appropriate
        2. Only vector type(like: float[?]) support KNN queries and the name of vector column often end with "_embedding". So, you can use knn queries to search when the column name you need to search for ends with "_embedding" or when the column name with "_embedding" is also in the list.
        3. In any complexity level, you can choose to use KNN queries if need.
        4. When using KNN queries, you have to add LIMIT or 'And k = ?' constraint but do not use them all in the same statement. This rule is very important, do not forget to add LIMIT or 'And k = ?' constraint after MATCH operator.
        5. The lembed function is used to transform a string into a vector, whose type and size match the corresponding column type in the data table. The function has two parameters, the first parameter is the name of the embedding model used (default value: {embedding_model}), and the second parameter is the content of the string type you want to convert. So, you should generate some words or sentences with specific semantic information based on name, type and comment of this column. For example, you can generate "The Daily Grind Coffee Shop\n 456 Oak Avenue\n Springfield, IL 62704\n USA" when this column name is Location_embedding, column type is float[384] and comment of column is "the embedding of location".
        6. The lembed function's second parameter MUST be a SPECIFIC semantic description.
        - For location_embedding: Generate REAL addresses (e.g. "Stadium: 123 Main St, Boston, MA. Capacity: 50,000. Home team: Patriots")
        - For columns containing semantically meaningful data (e.g., descriptions), generate rich, contextually appropriate information. For columns without meaningful content (e.g., placeholder names), avoid creating semantically dense output to facilitate fuzzy matching operations.
        - For name_embedding: You should generate variationsof the original names (e.g., altered spellings, phonetic approximations, or intentionally obfuscated words/characters) to enable Subsequent fuzzy matching to identify semantically similar names. Importantly, never generate redundant information. For example, you can generate "Lige", but do not generate "Ligand Lige", "Ligand example name", "Ligand similar to Aspirin" and "Ligand name variation".
        Examples:
        Correct:
            name_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "Kri")
        Wrong:
            name_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "A leading publisher based in Germany specializing in
        scientific journals and books.")
        - For text_embedding: Use ACTUAL and meaningful sentences (e.g. "Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbirdis a timeless exploration of racial injustice and moral growth, seen through the innocent yet perceptive eyes of Scout Finch. With its powerful themes, unforgettable characters like Atticus Finch, and Lee's poignant prose, the novel remains a searing critique of society's failures and a testament to the courage of standing for what's right.")
        - NEVER use vague words and generic phrases like "a book review"
        Examples:
        Correct:
            lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "To Kill a Mockingbird")
        Wrong:
            lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "name of a famous book")
        7. When using MATCH, please fill in a vector using function lembed after MATCH that matches the column type (with the same dimension and type). Using details are in examples.
        8. The distance column is an implicitly generated metric that appears when performing vector similarity searches (using the MATCH operator) in SQLite vector extensions like sqlite-vec. If using JOIN operator, you have to clarify which table that distance belongs to.
        9. A SELECT statement should have no more than one MATCH operation. However, each subquery within a SELECT statement could also have no more than one MATCH operation, independent of the parent query."
        10. When performing a KNN/vector similarity search (e.g., using MATCH or lembed), always specify a LIMIT or k=N constraint directly on the vector search operation, even if the outer query already has a LIMIT. The vector search requires its own result cap to avoid ambiguity in ranking and performance issues.
        11. When both LIMIT and k operations are available for vector search queries, prioritize using k operation for Broader Compatibility.
        Key Points:
        --Vector search needs its own LIMIT/k - The outer LIMIT applies to the final filtered results, not the initial similarity search.
        --LIMIT operator should follow closely after "ORDER BY distance".
        Wrong Example:
        ```sql
        SELECT a.codec_name
        FROM audio_codecs a
        JOIN quality_levels q ON a.codec_id = q.quality_id
        WHERE a.description_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "High efficiency audio codec with low latency and optimal bandwidth")
        AND q.quality_name = 'HighQuality'
        LIMIT 1;
        ```
        Correct Example:
        ```sql
        SELECT a.codec_name
        FROM audio_codecs a
        JOIN quality_levels q ON a.codec_id = q.quality_id
        WHERE a.description_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "High efficiency audio codec with low latency and optimal bandwidth") LIMIT 1
        AND q.quality_name = 'HighQuality';
        ```
        --When using JOIN operations, you need to ensure that k does not cause ambiguity in the query. In most cases, the k parameter logically belongs to the same table as the column used in the MATCH clause. So, when the column referenced in the MATCH clause includes a table qualifier (e.g., table1.embedding), the k parameter must be explicitly bound to the same table.
        Wrong Example:
        ```sql
        SELECT s.stock_id, s.symbol
        FROM stocks s
        JOIN exchanges e ON s.exchange_id = e.exchange_id
        WHERE s.sector_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "Tech industry sector in the USA")
        AND e.country = 'USA'
        AND k = 5
        ORDER BY s.stock_id;
        ```
        Correct Example:
        ```sql
        SELECT s.stock_id, s.symbol
        FROM stocks s
        JOIN exchanges e ON s.exchange_id = e.exchange_id
        WHERE s.sector_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "Tech industry sector in the USA")
        AND e.country = 'USA'
        AND s.k = 5
        ORDER BY s.stock_id;
        ```
        12. ​Avoids runtime errors  - Many vector databases (e.g., SQLite with sqlite-vss, pgvector) enforce this requirement strictly.
        13. Only a single 'ORDER BY distance' clause is allowed on vec0 KNN queries, not on other columns.
        ***Example of KNN queries of sqlite-vec***
        first example(type of vector_embedding is float[384]):
        ```sql
        SELECT rowid, distance
        FROM vec_table
        WHERE vector_embedding MATCH lembed({embedding_model},"vector of sun")
        ORDER BY distance
        LIMIT 1;
        ```

        second example(type of sentence_embedding is float[384]):
        ```sql
        select
        movie_id,
        title,
        genre,
        num_reviews,
        mean_rating,
        distance
        from vec_movies
        where sentence_embedding match lembed({embedding_model},"This is a great movie!")
        and genre = 'scifi'
        and num_reviews between 100 and 500
        and mean_rating > 3.5
        and k = 5;
        ```

        third example(type of vector_embedding is float[384]):
        ```sql
        select rowid, name1, name2, age, vec_to_json
        from v
        where vector_embedding match lembed({embedding_model},"aaa and xxx are good friends, whose age is 18.")
        and k = 1
        and name1 in ('alex', 'brian', 'craig')
        and name2 in ('Rick', 'Morty')
        and age in (21, 18);
        ```

        **Guiding Principles for High-Quality Vector Questions:**

        Your ultimate goal is to create a question that a real human would ask. To do this, you must internalize the following principles:

        1.  **Translate Mechanism into Intent (The Golden Rule!)**: A vector search (`MATCH ... LIMIT N`) is a technical mechanism to find the "top N" or "best N" examples of something. Your question **MUST** reflect the user's *intent*, not the mechanism.
            * **Prohibited Phrases**: Avoid technical jargon that describes the search process. Do NOT use phrases like: "most closely related to", "semantically similar to", "based on similarity", "concept of", "field of".
            * **Approved Phrasing**: Instead, use natural language that implies ranking or quality. Use words like: "top 5", "best", "most representative", "leading", or simply state the entity directly. For example, a search for the top 5 professors should be phrased as "Who are the top 5 professors?", not "Who are the 5 professors most similar to the concept of a professor?".

        2.  **Identify and Preserve Key Entities**: Within the `lembed()` text, identify the core keywords (e.g., "Professor", "Computer Science", "leadership skills"). These **MUST** be present in the final question to ensure it is specific and meaningful.

        3.  **Rephrase Naturally, Do Not Copy Verbatim**: While preserving key entities, change the overall sentence structure to fit the requested style (Formal, Colloquial, etc.). Do not copy the entire `lembed()` string word-for-word.

        ---
        **Examples of Correct vs. Incorrect Behavior:**

        **Example 1: Being Natural--like a real human would ask**
        * **Input VecSQL**: `... WHERE p.hasPosition_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "Professor of Computer Science") AND k = 5 ...`
        * **BAD Question**: `"Identify five professors whose roles most closely match the concept of teaching computer science at a professorial level..."` or `"Please provide the IDs, names, and course levels for the five professors who have positions most closely related to the field of computer science, ordered by similarity."`
            * **Reasoning**: This is the classic mistake. It describes the vector search mechanism ("most closely related to") instead of asking a direct, human-like question. Too verbose and abstract. "concept of teaching computer science at a professorial level" or "who have positions most closely related to" is an unnatural way to say "Computer Science Professor".
        * **GOOD Question**: `"Please provide the IDs and course levels for the 5 professors who specialize in computer science."` or `"Identify five computer science professors and list the levels of the courses they teach."`
            * **Reasoning**: Correctly uses the key entities "Professor" and "Computer Science" in a formal and direct manner.

        **Example 2: Preserving Entities**
        * **Input VecSQL**: `... WHERE p.hasPosition_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "Professor of Mathematics") LIMIT 5 ...`
        * **BAD Question**: `"Could you please find the top 5 individuals most semantically related to a specialized academic teaching role..."`
            * **Reasoning**: Completely fails by losing the essential key entities **"Professor"** and **"Mathematics"**. The question is now uselessly vague.
        * **GOOD Question**: `"Get me the top 5 people who are very professional in mathematics, and show me their course levels."`
            * **Reasoning**: Preserves the critical entities in a natural, imperative sentence.

        **Example 3: Being Natural**
        * **Input VecSQL**: `... WHERE performance_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "exceptional performance with leadership skills") LIMIT 1;`
        * **BAD Question**: `"Hey, could you help me find the employee whose performance is most closely related to being a standout leader?"`
            * **Reasoning**: "most closely related to being..." is clunky and not like a real human would ask. It also loses the "exceptional performance" aspect.
        * **GOOD Question**: `"Hey, can you find the employee who performance very well and with great leadership ability'? I need their SSN."` or `"Who's our top employee showing both great performance and leadership? Grab their SSN for me."`
            * **Reasoning**: Sounds like a real person talking and naturally incorporates the key concepts.

    def _get_sqlite_vec_description(self):
        return """There are a few Requirements you should Comply with in addition, else you can ignore these requirements below.
1. When generating SQL queries， you should prioritize utilizing KNN searches whenever contextually appropriate. However, you have to avoid unnecessary/forced KNN implementations for:
--Traditional relational data queries (especially for columns like: id, age, price)
--Cases where standard SQL operators (equality, range, or aggregation functions) are more efficient and semantically appropriate
2. Only vector type(like: float[?]) support KNN queries and the name of vector column often end with "_embedding". So, you can use knn queries to search when the column name you need to search for ends with "_embedding" or when the column name with "_embedding" is also in the list.
3. In any complexity level, you can choose to use KNN queries if need.
4. When using KNN queries, you have to add LIMIT or 'And k = ?' constraint but do not use them all in the same statement. This rule is very important, do not forget to add LIMIT or 'And k = ?' constraint after MATCH operator.
5. The lembed function is used to transform a string into a vector, whose type and size match the corresponding column type in the data table. The function has two parameters, the first parameter is the name of the embedding model used (default value: {embedding_model}), and the second parameter is the content of the string type you want to convert. So, you should generate some words or sentences with specific semantic information based on name, type and comment of this column. For example, you can generate "The Daily Grind Coffee Shop\n 456 Oak Avenue\n Springfield, IL 62704\n USA" when this column name is Location_embedding, column type is float[384] and comment of column is "the embedding of location".
6. The lembed function's second parameter MUST be a SPECIFIC semantic description. 
   - For location_embedding: Generate REAL addresses (e.g. "Stadium: 123 Main St, Boston, MA. Capacity: 50,000. Home team: Patriots")
   - For columns containing semantically meaningful data (e.g., descriptions), generate rich, contextually appropriate information. For columns without meaningful content (e.g., placeholder names), avoid creating semantically dense output to facilitate fuzzy matching operations.
   - For name_embedding: You should generate variationsof the original names (e.g., altered spellings, phonetic approximations, or intentionally obfuscated words/characters) to enable Subsequent fuzzy matching to identify semantically similar names. Importantly, never generate redundant information. For example, you can generate "Lige", but do not generate "Ligand Lige", "Ligand example name", "Ligand similar to Aspirin" and "Ligand name variation".
   Examples:
   ✅ Correct: 
     name_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "Kri")
   ❌ Wrong:  
     name_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "A leading publisher based in Germany specializing in 
scientific journals and books.")
   - For text_embedding: Use ACTUAL and meaningful sentences (e.g. "Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbirdis a timeless exploration of racial injustice and moral growth, seen through the innocent yet perceptive eyes of Scout Finch. With its powerful themes, unforgettable characters like Atticus Finch, and Lee’s poignant prose, the novel remains a searing critique of society’s failures and a testament to the courage of standing for what’s right.")
   - NEVER use vague words and generic phrases like "a book review"   
   Examples:
   ✅ Correct: 
     lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "To Kill a Mockingbird")
   ❌ Wrong:  
     lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "name of a famous book")
7. When using MATCH, please fill in a vector using function lembed after MATCH that matches the column type (with the same dimension and type). Using details are in examples.
8. The distance column is an ​​implicitly generated metric​​ that appears when performing vector similarity searches (using the MATCH operator) in SQLite vector extensions like sqlite-vec. If using JOIN operator, you have to clarify which table that distance belongs to.
9. A SELECT statement should have no more than one MATCH operation. However, each subquery within a SELECT statement could also have no more than one MATCH operation, independent of the parent query."
10. When performing a KNN/vector similarity search (e.g., using MATCH or lembed), always specify a LIMIT or k=N constraint directly on the vector search operation, even if the outer query already has a LIMIT. The vector search requires its own result cap to avoid ambiguity in ranking and performance issues. 
11. When both LIMIT and k operations are available for vector search queries, prioritize using k operation for ​​Broader Compatibility.
Key Points:
​--​Vector search needs its own LIMIT/k​​ – The outer LIMIT applies to the final filtered results, not the initial similarity search.
--LIMIT operator should follow closely after "ORDER BY distance". 
❌ Wrong Example: 
```sql
SELECT a.codec_name
FROM audio_codecs a
JOIN quality_levels q ON a.codec_id = q.quality_id
WHERE a.description_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "High efficiency audio codec with low latency and optimal bandwidth")
AND q.quality_name = 'HighQuality'
LIMIT 1;
```
✅ Correct Example:
```sql
SELECT a.codec_name
FROM audio_codecs a
JOIN quality_levels q ON a.codec_id = q.quality_id
WHERE a.description_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "High efficiency audio codec with low latency and optimal bandwidth") LIMIT 1
AND q.quality_name = 'HighQuality';
```
--When using JOIN operations, you need to ensure that k does not cause ambiguity in the query. In most cases, the k parameter logically belongs to the same table as the column used in the MATCH clause. So, when the column referenced in the MATCH clause includes a table qualifier (e.g., table1.embedding), the k parameter must be explicitly bound to the same table.
❌ Wrong Example: 
```sql
SELECT s.stock_id, s.symbol
FROM stocks s
JOIN exchanges e ON s.exchange_id = e.exchange_id
WHERE s.sector_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "Tech industry sector in the USA")
AND e.country = 'USA'
AND k = 5
ORDER BY s.stock_id;
```
✅ Correct Example:
```sql
SELECT s.stock_id, s.symbol
FROM stocks s
JOIN exchanges e ON s.exchange_id = e.exchange_id
WHERE s.sector_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', "Tech industry sector in the USA")
AND e.country = 'USA'
AND s.k = 5
ORDER BY s.stock_id;
```
12. ​Avoids runtime errors​​ – Many vector databases (e.g., SQLite with sqlite-vss, pgvector) enforce this requirement strictly.
13. Only a single 'ORDER BY distance' clause is allowed on vec0 KNN queries, not on other columns.
***Example of KNN queries of sqlite-vec***
first example(type of vector_embedding is float[384]):
```sql
SELECT rowid, distance 
FROM vec_table 
WHERE vector_embedding MATCH lembed({embedding_model},"vector of sun")
ORDER BY distance 
LIMIT 1;
```

second example(type of sentence_embedding is float[384]):
```sql
select
  movie_id,
  title,
  genre,
  num_reviews,
  mean_rating,
  distance
from vec_movies
where sentence_embedding match lembed({embedding_model},"This is a great movie!")
  and genre = 'scifi'
  and num_reviews between 100 and 500
  and mean_rating > 3.5
  and k = 5;
```

third example(type of vector_embedding is float[384]):
```sql
select rowid, name1, name2, age, vec_to_json
from v
where vector_embedding match lembed({embedding_model},"aaa and xxx are good friends, whose age is 18.")
  and k = 1
  and name1 in ('alex', 'brian', 'craig')
  and name2 in ('Rick', 'Morty')
  and age in (21, 18);
